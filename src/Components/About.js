          <h2>What is the L-Night group?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The L-Night Berlin group was founded in April 2013. The original
          organizers have changed but the group is going strong. We could safely
          say that the L-Night is one of the most regular meetings for English
          speaking queer and lesbian women / LGBTQIA* in Berlin. Queer visibility is
          important and that is also why this group is so precious in many ways.
          L-Night has been bringing people together already almost for a decade!
        </p>

          L-night Berlin group is a friendly, (mainly) English-language social
          group for queer women and non-binary individuals who feel they have a
          connection to the women's community. We particularly welcome women who
          are marginalised within the LGBTQIA+ community, such as trans women,
          women of colour, older women, disabled women and other similar groups.
        </p>
        <h3>When do we meet?</h3>
        <p>
          We meet mostly every Tuesday around 8pm and occasionally on weekends
          for special events/clubs. We have had also our first official L-Night
          party event couple years ago and have bigger plans ahead!
        </p>
        <h3>What kind of events do we have?</h3>
        <p>
          Venues change week to week as we explore queer and alternative spaces
          stretching from Prenzlauer Berg to NeukÃ¶lln and beyond. Past events
          include park outings, BBQs, club nights, Christmas markets and many
          other events. We have many favourite bars but new suggestions are
          always welcome.
        </p>

          L-night has expanded steadily since its creation in April 2013. We
          have around 3,000 members in Facebook and Meetup. Our weekly meetings
          are always on (virtually when needed) and always growing with new
          members and venue locations. If you're looking to expand your circle
          of friends or enjoy a drink or trip to the park with like-minded
          people, join us on Tuesday!
